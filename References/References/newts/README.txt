1. Introduction
newts is a piece of free software which sells and prints tickets for event. It allows multiple shows, and multiple performances and ticket types per show. The software can also export reports of transactions in an Excel compatible format. This is an early beta release and not quite reasy for use in a production environment.

2. Installation
No installation is required. Simply unzip the newts-bin.zip file and double click on the newts icon in the unzipped folder.

3. Using the software
When you start newts for the fist time it will ask you if you want to create a database. You should answer yes. The main login window will then appear. This allows you to log in as either user, manager, or admin. To sell tickets, the user login is most appropriate. To allow refunds and reporing, manager access is required, and to create, delete or edit shows, you should log-in as admin. For this release the passwords are hard-coded to match the username.

Administration functions
You must log in as admin if you wish to edit Show, Ticket, or General admin details.
Then click on the Admin tab, and the admin function should be self-explanatory.

Manager functions
In order to carry out refunds or view reports on sales you must be logged in as manager.
In order to give refunds, log in, click on the Refund tab, select the show, performance, and ticket amounts to be refunded. Then click on refund, you will be shown the amount to be refunded and asked to confirm the refund.

Staff functions
To sell tickets you must only log in as user. Click on Quick Sale. Select Show, Performance, the number of each type of ticket, the payment type, and finally click on Sell & Print. You will then be asked to confirm the sale and the requested tickets will be printed immediately.
